# Temperature Analysis GUI
  This is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library. The GUI allows users to analyze temperature data from a CSV file, specifically focusing on maximum temperatures in the month of January. The script calculates and displays the mean temperature, standard deviation, and the maximum temperature at the 95th percentile using a normal distribution. It also generates a histogram of the daily maximum temperature data.

## Installation
  This script requires Python 3.x to be installed. You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
  
  pip install pandas matplotlib scipy

## Usage
To use the GUI, simply run the script in your terminal:
python temperature_analysis_gui.py

A window will appear with a text box prompting the user to enter the path to a CSV file. Once the file path is entered and the "Submit" button is clicked, the script will process the data and display the results in the text box.
